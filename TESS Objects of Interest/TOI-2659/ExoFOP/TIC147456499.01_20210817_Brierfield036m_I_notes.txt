
Hi Karen 

Don Radford observed a full on 20210817 in R and detected a on time 24 ppt event in an uncontaminated 8.8" target aperture.

A full  transit of TIC 147456499.01 TOI 2659.01 in the R filter, was performed on 17/08/2021 in a 8.8  arcsec uncontaminated aperture, showing a 6 minute early  on target 24 ppt transit (Tess predicted 22.3 ppt).

Transit Duration was 123.8 mins (Tess Pdt. 108 mins) 4 σ longer than predicted.

Measured Tc was at 2459444.124163094.  Predicted Tc was = 9444.1248  ( ie mid transit 9 mins early)

A NEB check was performed on the 2 other Gaia stars. All were formally cleared.

Imaging was performed over at total of 416.5 mins. 
  
The Comments in TTF were "QLP S30 PC: found in faint-star QLP search; Confirm event on target and/or check field for NEBs within 2.5' using a red (rp, R, ip, I, z) filter."
