TIC 332534326-01 (TOI-2714.01) on UT2021.10.16 from LCO-McD-0m4 in gp

Rick Schwarz/LCO-McD-0m4 analyzed a full on 20211016 in gp and detected an 11 min (5.5σ) early 
~10 ppt transit using an uncontaminated 6.8" target aperture.

APERTURE RADIUS: 6.8" (12 px).
PREDICTED Tc: 9503.8671
MEASURED Tc:  9503.8593 (11 min [5.5σ] early)
NEBCHECK STARS NOT CLEARED: NA
COMMENTS: There was noticeable reduction in transparency (evidenced by the decrease in tot_C_cnts) during 
a portion of the in-transit period.


GOAL(S): Perform a a high-precision (<1.0 ppt/5 min) full transit in a blue (gp) filter to check chromaticity. 

PREDICTED DEPTH: 10.6 ppt
OBSERVED DEPTH: 10.7 ppt 
RMS OF MODEL FIT: 5.2 ppt
PREDICTED DURATION: 179 min
OBSERVED DURATION: 179

OBSERVING NOTES:

Of the original stack of 57 images, Image No.25 was excessively noisy, and was deleted.  Final stack = 56 images.

Image shift statistics:
             stdev.(arc-seconds): 0.6543 in X and 0.6067 in Y
             max. deviation (pixels): 4.6344 in X and 4.8053 in Y

PREVIOUS TTF COMMENTS: QLP S31 VPC: found in faint-star QLP search; K. Barkaoui analyzed a full on 20211010 
in 0m4 ip and detected an on-time ~10 ppt transit in uncontaminated 7.4" target aperture. The next observation 
should be a high precision (<1.0 ppt/5 min) full transit in a blue (U, u', B, g') filter to check chromaticity. 
Multi-band observations preferred.
