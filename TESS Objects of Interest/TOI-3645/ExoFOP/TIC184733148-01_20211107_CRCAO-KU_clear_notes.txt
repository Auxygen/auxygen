Phill Reed and students/CRCAO-KU observed a full transit on 20211107 in CLEAR and detected a 44 min (0.2 σ) late ~11 ppt event on the target using an uncontaminated 9.3" target aperture, which is consistent with the KeplerCam result on 20211014. 

Aperture radius = 9.3"
Typical FWHM = 4.6"
Predicted Tc = 9525.6227
Measured Tc = 9525.6233


TTF (at time of observation):  QLP S18 PC: found in faint-star QLP search;  Confirm event on target and/or check field for NEBs within 2.5' using a red (rp, R, ip, I, z) filter.

TTF (current): QLP S18 VPC: [P=2.95972] found in faint-star QLP search; Allyson Bieryla observed a nominal full on 20211014 in KeplerCam ip and detected an ~45 min (0.2σ) late ~10 ppt event in an uncontaminated 3.4" target aperture. [P=2.95985] The next observation should be a high precision (<1.0 ppt/5 min) full transit in a blue (U, u', B, g') filter to check chromaticity. Multi-band observations preferred.
