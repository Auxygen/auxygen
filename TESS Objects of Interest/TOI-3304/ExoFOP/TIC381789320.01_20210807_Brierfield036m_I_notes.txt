
Hi Karen 

An Egress plus 60 %, of TIC 381789320.01 (TOI 3304.01)  in the I filter, was performed on 07/08/2021. Using a 7 pixel 10.29 arcsec  aperture, which is contaminated with T2 (TIC 1692177072), a 5.3 dmag, 6 arc sec East close neighbour. The combined T1/T2 target showed a 226 min (0.8 σ) early 9 ppt (Tess predicted 7.1 ppt) transit. 

A 3 pixel, 4.4 arcsec aperture, which excluded >50% of TIC 1692177072 showed an identical lightcurve (depth 9.5ppt) to the 10.29 arcsec curve. A 2 pixel, 2.9 arcsec aperture which largely excludes T2  introduced schematic variation but showed no decrease to the 226 min early transit depth. This suggests the Transit is on the target T1.

A NEB check was performed on the 172 other Gaia stars. Many were formally cleared but also many cross contaminated in this crowded field not formally cleared.
T6 which is TIC 381789314 (a Tess mag 14.78 star), 29 arcsec SW showed a suggestive 60-90 ppt dip (Not contaminated with any close stars) of longer duration starting at the predicted  ingress time.(unrelated to T1 detection).

Imaging was performed over at total of 514 mins.  RMS .00133.
 
The Comments in TTF were "QLP S13 PC: found in faint-star QLP search; Confirm event on target and/or check field for NEBs within 2.5' using a red (rp, R, ip, I, z) filter."

*114 x 240 sec exposures Bin 2x2 FWHM was 3.86 pixels or  5.66 arcsec (20 images at the end of imaging were discarded with heavy cloud interference)
*Detrend Parameters x used was  Sky/Pixel_T1 in 7pix curve and X(fitS) in the 3 pix curve.

Image shift statistics:
             stdev.(arc-seconds): 1.1423 in X and 0.7029 in Y
             max. deviation (pixels): 2.8029 in X and 2.0482 in Y
