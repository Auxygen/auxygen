TIC 144125079.01 (TOI 2661.01) on UT2021.09.15 from LCO-SSO-0m4 in ip

Hello Karen,

Greg Srdoc analyzed a full (e-227/i+214 min; -113.3/+106.8σ) on UT2021.09.15 in 0m4 ip and detected ~on time, ~10.1 ppt transit on target using 5.1" uncontaminated aperture.

Goal of this observation was to confirm event on target and/or check field for NEBs within 2.5' for TIC 144125079.01 (TOI 2661.01) on UT2021.09.15 in ip filter.

No unusable images removed from the stack.
A drop in tot_C_cnts just before egress can be observed in covariate curve. Applying Airmass+tot_C_cnts detrend gives transit depth much closer to predicted depth. Airmass only detrend also included.
Comps stars show some variations in lightcurves. target star lightcurve may be affected by this.

ExoFOP-TESS Data (2021-08-19; TESS Project) was the source for the User-Specified Parameters: Teff(K) = 5606, log(g) = 4.3 and P(d) = 3.6257584.
EXOFAST Quadratic Limb Darkening for parameters: Linear LD u1 = 0.33062449 and Quad LD u2 = 0.26464431.
Allowing rest of transit parameters to fit freely resulted in transit model a/R* = 10.8, b = 0.105, i(deg) = 90.
Observation produced an ~on time (BJD_TDB transit mid-point = 9473.2032), ~10.1 ppt transit (RMS for the model fit = 5.61ppt) with an optimized 9-30-45px aperture.
With airmass only detrend observation produced  ~14.1 ppt transit (RMS for the model fit = 5.56ppt).
NEB check clears 6 of 10 stars using 9px aperture.
