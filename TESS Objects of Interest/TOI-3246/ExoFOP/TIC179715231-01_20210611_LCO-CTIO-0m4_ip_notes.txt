TIC 179715231-01 (TOI-3246.01) on UT2021.06.11 from LCO-CTIO-0m4 in ip

Rick Schwarz/LCO-CTIO-0m4 analyzed a full  on 20210611 in ip and detected a 8 min (0.03σ) late ~10 ppt v-shaped 
transit using a uncontaminated 4.6" target aperture and cleared 45/45 neighbors.

APERTURE RADIUS: 4.6" (8 px).  
TYPICAL FWHM: 1.8" 
PREDICTED Tc: 9377.5839
MEASURED Tc:  9377.5893 (8 min [0.03σ] late)
NEBCHECK STARS NOT CLEARED: 12/45 - Gaia stars 2, 4, 6, 7, 12, 14, 19, 20, 22, 27, 37 & 45.  All 12 were cleared via 
inspection of their NEB Depth Plots, and by virtue of their relative dimness and separation from T1.  Final result: 
45/45 neighbors cleared.


GOAL(S): Confirm event on target and check field for NEBs within 2.5' using a red (ip) filter. 
PREDICTED DEPTH: 11.5 ppt
OBSERVED DEPTH: ~10 ppt 
RMS OF MODEL FIT: 2.8 ppt
PREDICTED DURATION: 210 min
OBSERVED DURATION: 210 min
