TIC 283303192-01 (TOI-2741.01) on UT2021.10.27 from LCO-HAL-0m4 in ip

1.  GOAL(S): 
    (1) Confirm event on target using a red (ip) filter. 
    (2) Check field for NEBs within 2.5'.

2.  INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS:
                  
    - An on-time, 12.8 ppt depth transit was detected on the target star using a 7.0 px target aperture (RMS for the model 
      fit = 5.5 ppt). The observed ingress depth equaled the predicted depth (12.9 ppt).  The model fit data were detrended
      for AIRMASS. 

    - The 7.0 px (3.99") target aperture excludes most of the flux from the 5" T2 neighbor (dmag = 2.72).
       
    - ExoFOP-TESS Data (20210819 TESS Project) were the source for the User-Specified Parameters: P = 2.988 days and R*/Rsun = 1.40; 
      and the Priors for the Transit Parameters: LDu1 = 0.206 and LDu2 = 0.317. 

    - Fifty-eight of the 67 Gaia stars within 2.5' were cleared using the NEB Check Tool.  The remaining nine were cleared by inspection
      of their NEB Depth Plots and by virtue of their relative dimness and separation from T1.
        
    - CONCLUSIONS:
      (1) An on-time, 12.8 ppt depth transit was detected on the target star.
      (2) The field was cleared to 2.5' during the observation period.
